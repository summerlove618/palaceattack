        <h1>GyeongBok<br>Palace</h1>
        <p>Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung Palace is also commonly referred to as the Northern Palace because its location is furthest north when compared to the neighboring palaces of Changdeokgung (Eastern Palace) and Gyeonghuigung (Western Palace) Palace.
            <br>
            <br>Gyeongbokgung Palace is arguably the most beautiful, and remains the largest of all five palaces. The premises were once destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (Japanese Invasions, 1592-1598).
            <br>
            <br>However, all of the palace buildings were later restored under the leadership of Heungseondaewongun during the reign of King Gojong (1852-1919).
