        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>This residence was built in 1873(the 10th year of King Gojong), five years after Gyeongbokgung Palace was rebuilt. Located in a secluded place in the northernmost part of the Palace, it was built for the king and the queen to enjoy peace and quiet. The residence followed the architecture of a typical scholar's residence, except for a few ornate decorations. 
        <br><br>
        <span class="title">Events</span><br>Geoncheonggung is famous for two events in Chosun history.<br>
1. Geoncheonggung is known as the first place to get electric lights by the installation of a generator from the Edison Electric Company in 1887.<br>
2. Geoncheonggung was the place where Empress Myeongseong was assassinated by the japanese assassins in 1895. (Eulmisabyeon)</p>
